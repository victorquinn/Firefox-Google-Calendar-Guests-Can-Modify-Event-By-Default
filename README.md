Firefox extension that enables the 'Guests can modify event' setting for Google Calendar by default, when creating a new event.

Shamelessly ported from [Robin Drexler's Chrome Extension](https://github.com/robin-drexler/Google-Calendar-Guests-Can-Modify-Event-By-Default). Full credit for that awesome extension, it just needed a Firefox port.
